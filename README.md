# **Description**
### A project to backup, update & download your files to & from Google Drive.
### What's so special about it? 
### 1. Supports folder & file **exclusions**. (Pretty neat for devs ðŸ§¡)
### 2. Any removed/modified/relocated folder/file is **updated**.
### 3. **Downloads** your files in the desired directory. 
### 4. **Maintains** your backuped folder structure both in Drive and after downloading it on your local machine.
### 5. Capable of storing **multiple** backups.

    git clone https://github.com/Kostas-Xafis/Google-Drive-Auto-Backup.git

### **3.** Add the downloaded json file to the project's /json directory and remove the **"installed"** key, so it looks like this:
```json
{
    "client_id": "<client_id>.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "project_id": "<project_id>",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_secret": "<client_secret>",
    "redirect_uris": ["urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob", "http://localhost"]
}
```
---
### **4.** Add a file named backupFile.json in the /json folder. Here you can add any glob pattern to exlude from your backup. You can have a general one or specify one for your backup's directory.
```json
{
  "excludePatterns": {
      "*": ["**/node_modules", "etc..."],
      "C:\\Users\\My_name\\personal\\projects\\etc...": [
          "**/.env",
          "**/.vscode",
          "**/target",
          "etc..."
      ]
  },
  "id": {}
}
```
